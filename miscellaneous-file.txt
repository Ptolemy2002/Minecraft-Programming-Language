This file will be copied directly into the target datapack. All files will, except python.

You can use it to add regular datapack assets or miscellaneous files to the pack.

Directories that begin with "#" are treated as libraries and are thus copied into the default namespace of the pack.
Other files are copied as they appear in the root relative to the data pack.

Empty directories will not be copied over.
