# Minecraft-Programming-Language
This will eventually support full data pack function creating through the language.
Roght now it only supports creating datapack tags and filtering them based on predefined properties (I've only imported the data for entities right now).

To use, you only need main.py, tags.py, and all imported required libraries. Write your code with mcscript and mctag files, then run main.py and you datapack will be created under the "generated" folder.
